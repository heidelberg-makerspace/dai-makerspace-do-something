# Do Something

This is our issue tracker for open tasks in the Makerspace.

Are you bored or just a nice person? Go through the [task list](https://github.com/heidelberg-makerspace/do-something/issues) and select one you can do. Report your progress in the issue for coordination and karma.

Besides the changing tasks in the list, an issue that is always open is [adding content to the wiki](https://wiki.heidelberg-makerspace.de/wiki/Building_the_Makerspace#Add_to_the_Wiki). Whether you write about a project or create a page from the [wanted list](https://wiki.heidelberg-makerspace.de/wiki/Special:WantedPages), the others will be grateful for any bit of shared wisdom!
